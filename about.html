		<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Marcel Regeci, and I'm a software engineer and medior Java developer. I was born on November 5th, 1996, and I'm passionate about technology and sports.</p>

    <p>I graduated with an Engineering degree in computer science from the Technical University in Kosice two years ago, and since then, I've been working as a software engineer. My expertise lies in Java development, and I'm always looking for new and exciting challenges to take on.</p>

    <p>In addition to my work, I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I believe that a happy life is all about balance, and for me, that means making time for the people who matter most.</p>

    <p>When I'm not working or socializing, you can usually find me pursuing one of my hobbies. I'm an avid sports enthusiast, and I love playing and watching a variety of sports. I'm also an indoor climber, and I love the challenge and physicality of this sport.</p>

    <p>Another hobby of mine is flying my DJi drone. I find it incredibly rewarding to capture aerial footage and explore the world from a different perspective.</p>
